title: About
---

With over a decade of experience in software quality engineering, I’ve worked across diverse products and teams to help deliver reliable, scalable, and user-focused software. My background spans both manual and automated testing, with a strong emphasis on building sustainable test strategies rather than treating QA as a final checkpoint.

I’ve worked as a Senior QA Engineer and QA Lead, collaborating closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders in agile environments. My work often focuses on test automation, API testing, and end-to-end testing, with hands-on experience using tools like Playwright, modern JavaScript/TypeScript stacks, and CI/CD pipelines. I care deeply about test design, risk-based testing, and ensuring quality is built in from the earliest stages of development.

Beyond hands-on testing, I’ve led QA initiatives, mentored junior and mid-level engineers, and helped teams improve their overall quality culture. I enjoy breaking down complex systems, asking the uncomfortable “what if” questions, and translating technical risks into clear, actionable insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.

I have experience testing cloud-based platforms, APIs, and data-driven systems, and I’m particularly interested in how QA evolves alongside AI-powered products, automation, and modern DevOps practices. I’m always learning whether that’s refining automation frameworks, improving observability in tests, or exploring better ways to validate complex system behavior.

When I’m not testing or automating, I enjoy sharing knowledge, reflecting on real-world QA challenges, and continuously improving how teams think about quality. This blog is where I document lessons learned, practical testing strategies, and thoughts on building resilient software in fast-moving environments.
